# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- **OpenDocument** (`.odt`, `.ods`, `.odp`), read directly from the package: headings, lists, merged cells, footnotes,
  charts, formulas as LaTeX, several tables per sheet, speaker notes.
- **RTF**, with a built-in parser: legacy code pages (CP949 and others), tables with merged cells, lists, footnotes,
  pictures.
- **EPUB**: chapters in reading order, pictures stored in the book, title and author metadata.
- **Word 97-2003 (`.doc`) and PowerPoint 97-2003 (`.ppt`)** through LibreOffice when it is installed. The
  `OPENDOCKIT_SOFFICE` environment variable sets the program path; an empty value disables the bridge.
- **Links and emphasis.** `ConvertOptions.keep_links` and `keep_emphasis` (both on by default) keep hyperlinks as
  `[text](url)` and bold / italic as `**bold**` / `*italic*` in DOCX, PPTX, HTML, ODT, ODP, RTF and EPUB.
- A comparison benchmark against four other converters in `benchmarks/`.

### Changed

- **Default output changes** for documents that contain links, bold or italic: the marks and addresses are now part of
  the text and of `char_count`. Pass `keep_links=False, keep_emphasis=False` for the 0.1 output.
- RTF, ODF, `.doc` and `.ppt` files are no longer rejected with `UnsupportedFormatError` (`.doc` / `.ppt` still are
  when LibreOffice is not installed).

### Fixed

- A converted `.ppt` no longer ends its speaker notes with a `<number>` line (a field-only text box on the notes page).


## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-12

First public release.

### Added

- `convert`, `convert_file` and `aconvert`: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, XLS, Excel 2003 XML, CSV, HWP, HWPX, HTML/MHTML,
  email (`.eml`, mbox), TXT, Markdown and image files to Markdown.
- `ConversionResult` with per-page / slide / sheet sections, metadata, warnings, extracted images and a character count.
- `ConvertOptions` with a character budget (`max_chars`) that stops conversion instead of truncating its output.
- `IsolatedConverter`: conversion in disposable worker processes with memory and time limits.
- `describe_images` and `OpenAIImageDescriber` (optional `openai` extra) to describe pictures and transcribe scanned pages;
  `OpenAIImageDescriber.check()` to fail fast on a missing extra or API key.
- `opendockit` command-line tool.
- `examples/`: sample documents for every format with their converted output.
- Optional `heic` extra for HEIC/HEIF images (kept out of the default install because its wheels bundle GPL/LGPL codecs).
